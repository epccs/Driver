Using three Orbit 58874N valves

RPUadpt^4 at address '1' is used for serial.

Note about having less current. The flow meter has a 900 Ohm pull-up that provides 12mA to the 100 Ohm sense resistor so I turned off the 10mA source from the RPUno^5 board. Also the current source that checks for a H-bridge short is off on K3^1 (saving about 3mA).

Drip zones are connected but they do not have the correct emitters yet. This test run was done at 18:43 to see what it looks like. For referance K3 is an orange tree, fig tree, grape vines, and raspberry. K2 is an overhead drip line that had misters last year, (don't mist it grows mold on the plants). K1 is a new over head drip line to where I had apple trees (apple trees got moved to the north side of the house).

Drip lines have the emitters now, so it is time to consider zone timing. I have been watering the K3 zone (orange tree...) for 50 min each day so I'll just keep doing that but will do it for 5 min every hour for ten hours. I'll delay it until after K1 and K3 are done (give them each a 10 min window)
