1. ^0 Solenoid Control with RPUno^5


## ^0 Solenoid Control with RPUno^5

An interactive Command Line Interface for [Solenoid][1] control is wired to LED's to see its function. In my [reset all video][2] each solenoid is cycled twice (opps), but the logic control is working. After connecting the K3 board I fixed the control program so it cycles each solenoid once as seen when [RPUno with K3 video][3] is seen.
